## 1. choice under uncertainty

+ real consumer behavior
  + instead of the rational choice model, use **expected utility** to replace **expected value**
  + **purpose**: model scenarios when individuals view risk differently

### 1.1. Von Neumann-Morgenstern: expected utility model

+ 处理不确定性决策问题
+ **utility function**: assigns a numerical measure to the satisfaction associated with different outcomes
+ **expected utility**: the sum of the utility associated with all possible outcomes multiplied by the likelihood of each outcome
+ analysis
  + in general, the preferred choice that maximized expected utility will not be the choice that maximized expected value
  + utility behaves differently from value because utility is a concave(凸) function of wealth normally

**risk-averse**: persons whose utility functions are concave in total would always refuse a gamble whose expected value is zero

**risk-seeker**: the expected utility of a fair gamble will always exceed the utility of refusing the gamble
