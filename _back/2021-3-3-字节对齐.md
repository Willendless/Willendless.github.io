We don’t usually need to be concerned about the alignment of our memory addresses, but as budding system’s programmers, we do! This is because hardware, protocols, and other external forces enjoin alignment properties. For example, the ARM 32-bit architecture requires the stack pointer to be 8-byte aligned. The AArch64 architecture, our operating system’s architecture of choice, requires the stack pointer to be 16-byte aligned; x86-64 requires the same alignment. Page addresses used for virtual memory typically need to be 4k-byte aligned.

In C, the alignment of a memory address returned from a libC allocator is guaranteed to be 8-byte aligned on 32-bit systems and 16-byte aligned on 64-bit systems. Beyond this, the caller has no control over the alignment of the returned memory address and must fend for themselves (POSIX functions like posix_memalign later corrected for this).

The choice to guarantee 8 or 16-byte alignment from libC’s malloc is not without reason. Why did libC choose these particular alignment guarantees?
