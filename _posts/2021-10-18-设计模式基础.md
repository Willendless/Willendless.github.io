+ hierarchy
  + design goal
    + design for change, understanding, reuse, division of labor
  + design principle
    + low coupling, high cohesion
    + low representational gap
    + law of demeter
  + design heuristic/patterns
+ **low coupling**: A module should depend on as few other modules as possible
+ **high cohesion**: A module should have a small set of related responsibilities

## 1. intro to OOP

+ **pillars of OOP**
  + **abstraction**: attributes and behaviors
  + **encapsulation**: interface
  + **inheritance**: code reuse
  + **polymorphism**: different implementation of *abstract method*

### 1.1. relations between objects

+ **inheritance**
+ **implementation**
+ **association**: a object interacts/communicates with another
  + in general used to represent a field in a class
  + 箭头 + 直线
+ **dependency**: weak variant of association, no permanent link between objects
  + typically implies that an object accepts another object as a method parameter
  + 箭头 + 虚线
+ **composition**: "whole-part" relationship between two objects, one is composed of one or more instances of the other (part of the container)
  + filled diamond + 直线 + 箭头
+ **aggregation**: a less strict variant of composition, container only contains references
  + the container doesn't control the life cycle of the component, which can be linked to several containers at the same time
  + empty diamond + 直线 + 箭头

## 2. intro to patterns

+ pattern description
  + intent of the pattern
  + motivation
  + structure of classes
  + code example
+ **idioms**: basic and low-level patterns to a single programming language
+ **architectural patterns**: can be used to design the architecture of an entire application
  + **creation patterns**: object creation mechanisms
  + **structural patterns**: how to assemble object and classes into larger structures
  + **behavioral patterns**: take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects

## 3. software design principles

+ code reuse
  + **level 1**: reuse class, libraries, containers, etc
  + **level 2**: patterns, higher granularity than class reuse but less risky and investment than framework
  + **level 3**: framework, lets programmer define customized behavior, and will call these behaviors when its your turn
+ extensibility
  + design for change

### 3.1. Design Principles

#### 3.1.1. encapsulate what varies

Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same, so that we can minimize the effect caused by changes

+ on method level
+ on class level

#### 3.1.2. program to an interface, not an implementation

Depend on abstractions, not on concrete classes

+ collaborate two classes
  + determine what exactly one object needs from the other: which methods does it execute
  + describe these methods in a new interface or abstract class
  + make the class that is a dependency implement this interface
  + make the second class dependent on the interface

#### 3.1.3. favor composition over inheritance

+ inheritance: **is a**
+ composition: **has a**

extending a class in several dimensions

instead of letting class implement behaviors on their own, delegate it to other objects

### 3.2. SOLID principles

+ Single Responsibility
  + **A class should have only one reason to change.**
  + Try to make every class responsible for a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and make that responsibility entirely encapsulated by (you can also say hidden within) the class.
+ Open/Closed Principle
  + **Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification**
+ Liskov Substitution Principle
  + **when extending a class, should be able to pass objects of the subclass in place of objects of the parent class without breaking the client code**
    + **parameter types**: match or more abstract than superclass
    + **return type**: match or be a subtype of the return type of the superclass
    + **a method in a subclass shouldn't throw types of exceptions which the base method isn't expected to throw**
    + pre-condition只能更宽，post-condition只能更窄
+ Interface Segregation Principle
  + **clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use**
  + try to make interfaces narrow enough
+ Dependency Inversion Principle
  + **High-level classes shouldn't depend on low-level classes. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions shouldn't depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.**
  + low-level class: implement basic operations
  + high-level class: contain complex business logic
  + **use interface to describe the function that the high level class needs first, then you can extend low level class without breaking existing classes**

## 4. hello world of design patterns

### 4.1. singleton pattern

+ 唯一性: class only have one instance
+ 全局性: global access point

### 4.2. factory method pattern

+ main modification
  + subclass overrides factory method to get different products based on its own type
  + make products follow the same interface
+ base class use abstract method without knowing the concrete type of the product

![](/assets/images/design-pattern/1-4.png)

+ **purpose**: the creator class already has some core business logic related to products, the factory method helps to decouple this logic from the concrete product classes
  + 通过继承，在不改变核心逻辑的情况下，将逻辑依赖的具有相同功能但有着不同实现的对象解耦出来
