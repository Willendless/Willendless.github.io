## 1. data protection purpose

+ protection from **user mistakes** (fat-fingering): delete file/filesystem/database by accident
  + solution: version control
+ protection from **device failures**: partial or full disk failures
  + solution: cross-device redundancy
+ protection from **site failures**: building destroyed by fire/earthquake
  + solution: redundancy off-site (online or offline)
+ data archiving: long-term data retention
  + solution: mechanism for saving, protecting, later reading

## 2. data backups

+ backup: periodic copies of entire file system, database, etc
  + time-consuming
  + costly
+ backup as data protection plan
  + recover files after user mistakes
  + recover system state after corruption
  + long-term archiving of data

### 2.1. 基于磁带的备份

![](/assets/images/ss/10-2.png)

+ bandwidth
  + 360MB/s or 900MB/s(with compression)
+ capacity
  + 12TB or 30TB (with compression)
+ time-to-data: latency to get to data
  + several sec of rewinding (114s from EOT)
+ media lifetime
  + read/write entire tape 10,000 times
  + bit error rate (BER): 1 error event in 1.25EB
  + endurance: 15-30 years
+ cost: **$ per byte stored and accessed**
  + storage: 2-3x cheaper than HDD
  + access: power only tapes you access

#### 2.1.1. tape mechanism

+ type 1: **read must start at the beginning**
  + cartridges have only 1 reel, and must be rewound
+ type 2: **landing zones throughput**
  + cassettes have 2 reels, wind to zone
+ type 3: **directory to help expedite seeks**
  + option 1: stored at beginning of tape
  + option 2: stored in NVRAM in tape container
  + enable **high-speed seeks to relative position on tape**

#### 2.1.2. tape performance: data access

+ **positioning**: position tape before data prior to accessing, tape should accelerate to the streaming speed to access data
+ **streaming**: tape must stream at specific speed to read/write
  + streaming speed was ~150 inches/second
+ **buffering**: system must supply tape drive bandwidth
  + if tape drive is faster, it stops until enough data is buffered

#### 2.1.3. tape management

+ tapes as block device
+ read/write tool: tar, dd, cpio, dump/restore
  + *tar* combines lots of files/directories into a single byte stream
  + *dd* copies bytes from any input to any output
+ position the tape
  + *mt* command

#### 2.1.4. tape storage issue

+ security
  + problem 1: moving tapes off-site as disaster protection, **where to put and how to guard these tapes**?
  + problem 2: **how to deleting files from off-site backup?**
    + encrypt with keys, lose keys to delete file, but **how to avoid losing keys by accident?**
+ reliability: 15-30 years, environmental conditions can affect tape lifetime

### 2.2. 基于磁盘的备份

+ reasons to use disk-based backup
  + online storage: faster restores
  + management ease
  + longer media lifetime
+ optimizations
  + **reduced power**: turn off disks when data is not accessed
  + **deduplication**: at source or at destination
  + **faster restores**

## 3. modern backup systems

+ components
  + **clients**: transmit backup data
  + **master server**: job scheduling, backup image metadata
  + **storage servers**: backup storage media management
+ **backup schedules**: when to backup clients
  + eg. full backups weekly, incremental backups daily
+ **backup policies**: how to backup different applications
+ backup types
  + **logical backups**: backup at the block level, i.e. copy every LBN
  + **physical backups**: backup at the file system level, i.e. interpret file system information and copy individual files
  + considerations
    + data hidden from file system? (like boot block)
    + CPU utilization (path lookup operation is expensive)
    + backup encrypted volume?
    + conserve backup storage?

### 3.1. consistent point-in-time backups

+ **problem**: what if the file system changes during a backup?
+ **option 1**: ensure the file system does not change during a backup
+ **option 2**: take a snapshot of the file system and back that up

#### 3.1.1. snapshot technique

+ snapshot: **virtual copies**
  + if something happens to the protected entity, then the snapshot will be useless
+ purposes
  + **easy recovery of deleted or corrupted files**
  + **source for replication or backup**
    + **replicate or back it up to some other device** for the snapshot to protect against media failure
+ main techniques
  + **copy-on-write**: copies any blocks to snapshot area before they are **overwritten** with new information
    + **three IOs for each write**: one read and two writes
    + snapshot read needs more computation time
  + **redirect-on-write**: **shadow paging**, use pointers to represent all protected entities and redirects on writes
    + **if a block needs modification, redirects the pointer for the written block and writes the data there**
    + better performance
  + analysis
    + cow: **used only as temporary sources for backup**
    + row: often created every hour or minutes, use it for medium-to-long-term protection **against file deletions and corruptions**

### 3.2. backup performance

+ optimization: parallelism
  + each tape drive cost $3000
+ optimization: incremental backup
  + *dump* incremental backup
    + backup only files than changed since the last backup
    + different levels backup
      + day 0: dump lvl 0, back up entire system
      + day N: dump lvl 2, backup only files that changed since last lvl 0 or lvl 1
      + day N+7: dump lvl 1, files that changed since last lvl 0
  + analysis
    + low capacity cost
    + more time to restore
        1. restore the last full backup
        2. apply all increments since then

real world: full backup with deduplication (similar to incremental, but with shorter restore time)

## 4. disaster recovery

+ people, nature, system, software, hardware
+ **backup was the most common method**
+ different levels of replacement plan
  + hot backup site
  + next box off the line: wait for new equipment to arrive and then restore from tape
  + cold backup site - empty site reserved in case of disaster
    + commercial: shared by multiple companies
    + mobile: truck that can move to customers location
+ **remote mirroring**
  + mirror all data on multiple sites
    + sync vs. async
      + in general, async
    + distance
    + support for network partitions
    + network
    + remote mirroring enables remote backup
  + implement remote mirroring
    + snapshot mirroring
    + EMC timefinder
      + mirrors inside EMC Symmetrix Storage Array
      + create multiple mirrors
        + if one mirror is detached
        + there are other mirrors still protecting your data
+ **remote data centers**
  + when network costs continue to drop, we can store all of our data remotely
  + use local disk as cache
  + remote site is responsible for managing data
  + "cloud storage": not yet primary private data center storage
