> Cache Coherence问题发生的位置: 共享cache和独享cache 的边界。多核系统中，处理器写请求commit的时间: 该写请求被其他所有核确认，注意这个时间和write complete的时间（值被更新到cache line中）并不相同。

## 1. coherence的定义

A memory system is coherent if:

The results of a parallel program's execution are such that for **each memory location**, there is a hypothetical serial order of all program operations (executed by all processors) to the location that is consistent with the results of execution, and:

1. Memory operations issues by any one processor occur in the order issued by the processor
2. The value returned by a read is the value written by the **last write to the location as given by the serial order**.

**注意**: 即使是单处理器系统其实也存在coherence问题，因为各个硬件和处理器共享内存，因此硬件映射内存通常都被设置为not-cachable。

+ **obeys program order**: A read by processor P to address X that follows a write by P to address X, should return the value of the write by P.
+ **write propagation**: A read by processor P1 to address X that follows a write by process P2 to X returns the written value
+ **write serialization**: **two writes to address X by any two processors observed in the same order by all processors**







**true sharing**: cache line size增长，locality增长，true sharing的开销被均摊了，因此减少true sharing。

**false sharing**: cache line size increase, probability of false sharing increases


## 2. snoopy based coherence protocol

## 3. VI

### 3.1. MSI

### 3.2. MESI

## 4. directory based coherence protocol

点到点通信

hyperqueue

+ one entry per cache line memory
  + dirty
  + present
+ point to point communication
  + local node: node where a request originates
  + home node: node where the memory location of an address resides
  + remote node: node that has a copy of a cache block, whether exclusive or shared

### 4.1. 优化1: 减小存储空间

+ 有限指针
+ sparse directory

### 4.2. 优化2: 减小通信开销

## 5. implementation of snoopy based cache

### 5.1. 实现1: 原子总线

### 5.2. 实现2: transaction-split总线

idea 区分事务请求和响应

+ 问题1: 匹配请求和响应
  + request table
+ 问题2: 处理冲突
  + disallow conflicting requests
  + each processor has a copy of request table
+ 问题3: 流控制
  + negative acknowledgement
+ 问题4: snoop结果报告的时机
  + 



condition1: program order
condition2:
