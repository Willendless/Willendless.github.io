> 我们的晚餐，可不是来自屠夫、酿酒商和面包师的仁慈，而是来自他们对自己利益的关注。我们不求助于他们的博爱，而是求助于他们的自利心；我们谈论的绝不是我们自己的需要，而是他们的好处。

微观经济学研究的是资源稀缺情况下如何做出选择。事实上，总是有资源是稀缺的，例如时间、能源，以及我们必须的，用于达成个人目标的东西。

## 1. 专有名词

+ cost benefit analysis
+ marginal cost: 边际成本，每一单位新增产品导致的总成本的增量
+ external cost: a cost that falls on people who are not directly involved in the activity
+ consumer surplus: 消费者剩余，购买者的支付意愿减去购买者的实际支付量。用于衡量购买者自己感觉所获得的额外利益。
+ equilibrium price: 均衡价格，商品的供给曲线和需求曲线相交时的价格。即商品的市场供给量和市场需求量相等时的价格。
+ real price of a product: price of a product relative to prices of other products and services
+ opportunity cost
  + mutually exclusive choices
    + 互相正交的选择
  + sunk costs: 沉没成本
    + 已付出且不可收回的，独立于决策的成本
+ rationality
  + assume behavior can be modeled rational
+ price ceiling
  + the level above which the price of a good is not permitted by law to rise
+ subsidy: 补贴

## 2. cost benefit model

**Whether to perform the action?** && **To which extent should I perform the action?**

+ **MODEL**: If the B(x) > C(x), do x; otherwise don't
  + B(x): benefits of doing x
    + **maximum dollar amount people would willing to pay to do x**
  + C(x): costs of doing x
    + **value of all the resources people must give up in order to do x**
+ **reservation price** of activity x
  + the price at which a person would be indifferent between doing x and not doing x
+ pitfall 1: ignoring implicit costs
  + **opportunity cost**
+ pitfall 2: failing to ignore sunk cost
  + If a cost has already been incurred and cannot be recovered, it is irrelevant for all decisions about the future.
  + **sunk cost**, costs that are beyond recovery at the moment a decision is made
+ pitfall 3: measuring costs and benefits as proportions rather than absolute dollar amounts
  + when using the cost-benefit test, costs and benefits should be in absolute dollar terms
+ pitfall 4: failure to understand the average-marginal distinction
  + **we should keep increasing the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its marginal cost**

## 3. supply and demand

**market**: A market consists of the buyers and sellers of a good or service.

### 3.1. customer side of market - demand curve

+ demand curves
  + v axis: **real price**
  + h axis: how many products that buyers wish to purchase
  + **horizontal interpretation**: for a specific price, quantity demanded
  + **vertical interpretation**: for a specific quantity, buyer's reservation price
+ **the law of demand**
  + when price falls, the quantity demanded increases
  + why
    + **people switch to a close substitute**
    + **people are not able to buy as much as before**

### 3.2. seller side of market - supply curve

+ for a supplier to be willing to sell a product, its price should cover the marginal cost of producing or acquiring it
+ **the law of supply**
  + when the price of a product rises,  firms offer more of it for sale
    + why?
      + when the price rises, the number of products before the price becomes less than the margin cost will increase
      + when price rises, more producers switch to this product
  + interpretation
    + horizontal: for a specific price, how much does the supplier be willing to sell
    + vertical: for a specific supply quantity, the value of marginal cost

**equilibrium value**: price, quantity pair that makes both supplier and customer happy

+ excess supply, surplus
  + price is higher than equilibrium price
+ excess demand, shortage
  + price is lower than equilibrium price

property:

If price and quantity take anything other than their equilibrium values, however, it will always be possible to reallocate so as to make at least some people better off without harming others.

**function of price**

+ rationing function: ration existing supplies of good
+ allocative function: acts as a signal that guides resources away from the production of goods whose prices lie below cost toward the production of goods whose prices exceed cost.

**design economic system**

自由市场能够达到或不能达到的特点如下

1. efficient: does not waste resources
    + resources: labor, energy...
    + yes
2. maximize wealth creation
    + yes
3. equity
    + no
4. stability
    + no
5. sustainable
    + no
6. grow
    + 增长来源: population, innovation
    + yes
7. innovation: per goods per person
    + yes

**free market system - need what to be true to function properly**

+ many buyers/sellers
+ symmetric information - perfect
+ no barriers to transaction
+ private property rights
+ cost/benefit distribution
  + 可能有collective benefit，但不一定对个人有足够的benefit

## 4. demand and supply functions

+ Demand functions
  + Qx = f(Px, Py, Income, Number of buyers, Taxes, Expectations)
    + Px: prices of goods(ex. car)
    + Py: prices of other goods(ex. gasoline, scooters)
+ Supply functions
  + Qx = f(Px, Pinputs, Technology, Taxes, Expectations)
  + revenue - cost: 供应商倾向于利益最大化

Demand quantity is the decrease function of price.

Supply quantity is the increase function of price.

Demand和Supply价格、数量曲线相交的点就是**equilibrium price**（均衡价格）。由于供需的相互作用，市场价格倾向于均衡价格。

![](/assets/images/econ/4-2.png)

+ A: sum of all the value to consumers
+ B: sum of all the value to suppliers
+ C: cost of all the products
+ **Markets exist to maximize consumer surplus**
  + if the price moves in any direction from the equilibrium price, the area of 'A' gets smaller

需求增加，demand曲线右移，均衡价格增加，数量增多。

供应增加，supply曲线右移，均衡价格减小，数量增多。

均衡价格的特点

+ no excess supply or demand
+ no other allocation of resources can create more aggregate value for consumers

### 4.1. distortions to free markets

+ **subsidy**: demand is inelastic and supply shocks are normal
+ **price controls**: when supply is only weakly dependent on price and demand is strongly dependent on price
  + price support
  + price ceiling
+ **taxes**: adjustment to price
