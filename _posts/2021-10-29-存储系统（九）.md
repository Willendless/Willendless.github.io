> When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.

## 1. data model

+ sparse, distributed, persistent, multidimensional sorted map
  + row key: string
  + col key: string
  + timestamp: int 64
+ **row**
  + atomic read and write under one row
  + **tablet**: range of sorted rows
+ **column family**
  + column key: `family:qualifier`
  + access control
  + disk and memory accounting
+ **timestamp**
  + system/user defined
  + per-column-family setting and garbage collection options
      1. kept last n versions
      2. kept new-enough versions

## 2. architecture

+ data and log storage: **GFS**
  + **SSTable**: persistent **ordered** **immutable** key-value map
    + block sequence (typically 64kB)
    + block index stored at the end of the file
    + operation
      + **open**: load the index table to memory
      + **lookup**: binary search the in-memory index, and then reading the block from disk
+ highly-available and persistent distributed lock service: **Chubby**
  + **paxos for replicas' consistency**: five active replicas
  + **file and directory as lock**: lease in case client crash
  + responsibility:
    + store bootstrap information of bigtable
    + discover tablet servers
    + finalize tablet server deaths
    + store bigtable schema information
    + store access control list
+ cluster management system: job scheduling, machine failure management, machine monitoring

## 3. components implementation

+ **client library**
  + note: clients don't rely on the master for tablet location information
+ **master**
  + assign tablets to tablet servers
  + detect the addition and expiration of tablet servers
  + balance tablet-server load
  + garbage collection of files in GFS
  + handle schema changes
+ **tablet servers**
  + manages ten to thousand tablets

### 3.1. tablet location

+ three-level hierarchy
  + location of root tablet: in chubby
  + location of tablets in `METADATA` table
  + location of tablets (row key: table identifier + end row)
+ client side: cache tablet locations
  + empty cache: three network round-trips, including one to chubby
  + stale cache: up to size network round-trips
  + prefetch as optimization

### 3.2. tablet assignment

+ **each tablet is assigned to one tablet server**: so we can easily implement row-level atomic access
+ **master**
  + keep track of set of live tablet servers
  + keep track of current assignment of tablets to tablet servers
  + periodically ask to detect when a tablet server is no longer serving tablets
  + send tablet load request to assign/reassign the tablet
+ **chubby** keep track of tablet servers
  + tablet server acquire an exclusive lock on chubby

#### 3.2.1. master startup

+ master **acquire a master** lock in chubby
+ master scans the servers directory in chubby to **find live servers**
+ master communicates with live tablet server to **discover what tablets are already assigned**
+ master scans the `METADATA` table to **learn the set of tablets and assign those unassigned tablets**

#### 3.2.2. tablets change

+ master
  + add/delete tablet
  + merge two existing tablets
+ tablet server
  + split one tablet: commit the split by recording to `METADATA` table

### 3.3. tablet serving: durability

+ no-force policy
  + on commit, complete row written to redo log then memory buffer (memtable)
  + optimization: **group commit** to improve throughput
    + requirement1: sufficient parallelism
    + requirement2: sufficient transactions per second wanting to commit, which makes the flush operation a bottleneck
+ tablet recovery
  + tablet server reads metadata from `METADATA`, including
    + list of SSTables
    + set of redo points pointing to commit logs that may contain data for the tablet
  + read the indices of the SSTables into mem
  + reconstructs the memtable by applying all of the updates that have committed since the redo points
+ write operation
  + authorization: read the permitted writer list from chubby
  + write to the commit log (with group commit)
  + insert content to memtable
+ read operation
  + authorization
  + merge data from sequence of SSTables and the memtable(efficient since SSTable and memtable are sorted data structures)

### 3.4. compaction

+ *minor compaction*: when memtable reaches threshold, convert to a SSTable and write to GFS
  + goal 1: reduce memory usage of the tablet server
  + goal 2: reduce the amount of data has to be read from the commit log during recovery if server dies
+ *major compaction*: rewrites all SSTables into one SSTable
  + no deletion information or deleted data, therefore reclaim resources used by deleted data
