> Device Drivers typically divided into two pieces, top half accessed in call path from syscalls and may put thread to sleep until finished, bottom half run as interrupt routine.

## I/O Device Notifying the OS

```
                Application
-----POSIX API[open, read, write, close, etc]-----
                File System
-----Generic Block Interface[block read/write]-----
                Generic Block Layer
-----Specific Block Interface[protocol-specific read/write]-----
           Device Driver[SCSI, ATA, etc.]
```

### 1. polling

*programmed I/O (PIO)*: Main cpu involved in the data movement.

```c
while(**STATUS** == BUSY);
Write data to **DATA** register and address to **ADDRESS** register
Write command to **COMMAND** register
while(**STATUS** == BUSY);
```

Problem: polling waste cpu.

### 2. Interrupts

Instead of polling, the OS issue a request, put the calling process to sleep, and context switch to another task.

+ *example: keyboard*
  + keyboard *send* msg to processor containing the key value
  + processor not ready, its bus interface
    1. copy data to temp register
    2. acknowledges the keyboard
    3. *send* a **interrupt** signal to the processor
  + processor handles the interrupt in the next cycle
    + *send* the value over the bus to memory module
+ only suitable for slow device

*Problem*: livelock. Cpu only processes interrupts and never allows a user-level process to run and actually service the requests.
*Solution*: hybird
    + after handling interrupts, polling for a while until hardware queues are empty
        + if no further request or time-out, fall back to interrupt again
    + used in linux network driver with the name NAPI(New API)
*interrupt coalesce trade-off*: wait for a while (how long?) before raise interrupt so that multiple interrupts can be coalesced

### 3. DMA

1. processor sends a request (src disk addr, dest mem addr) to a disk controller to *READ* a block of data
2. disk sends data to mem

## Device interaction (CPU -> Device controller)

1. PIO through programmed I/O

+ *in* and *out* privileged instruction
+ must be executed in privileged mode(kernel mode)

2. Memory-mapped I/O

+ can executed in user mode
+ using *load* and *store* to address the register and buffer of I/O modules
+ physical address is system bus address
+ I/O modules translate bus address to register address internally

## Bus

> all devices has its own range of bus address space(physical address)

### Bus transaction

+ source module requires exclusive use of the bus: *data sender*
+ source module places a bus address of the destine module on the bus
+ source module signals *READY* wire to alert the dest module
+ dest module signals *ACKNOWLEDGE* wire after data copy
  + if synchronized, no ready&ack are needed, just need to check the address line on each clock cycle
+ source module release the bus

### Sync vs. Async

+ sync data transfer
  + Source & destination cooperate through a *shared lock*
+ Async data transfer
  + Source & destination cooperate through *explicit signal line*(acknowledge line)
