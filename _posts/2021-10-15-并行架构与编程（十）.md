```c
void deposit(Acct account, int amount) {
    atomic {
        int tmp = bank.get(account);
        tmp += amount;
        bank.put(account, tmp);
    }
}
```

+ **declarative construct**: perform this set of operations atomically

## 1. motivation of transactional memory

+ memory transaction
  + an atomic and isolated
+ atomicity (all or nothing)
  + upon transaction commit, all memory writes in a transaction take effect at once
  + on transaction abort, none of the writes appear to take effect
+ isolation
  + no other processor can observe writes before transaction commits
+ serializability
  + transactions appear to commit in a single serial order
+ durability
  + changes persist
  + but memory is not durable...

+ fine-grained lock: may prevent concurrency in tree-type data structures
+ transactional memory: only abort when read-write or write-write conflicts

### 1.1. LL/SC

+ LL/SC: lite version of transactional memory (single address), lock-free atomic read-modify-write operation
  + load_linked(x): load value from address and return current value
  + store_conditional(x, value): store value to x only if x hasn't been written to since corresponding LL
  + enable multiple temporary local operations between these two instructions
    + `ll(account value); tmp+=xxx; sc(account value);`
  + no ABA problem
+ implementation
  + CPU track the load-linked address at a cache-line granularity, such that any modification to any portion of the cache line (another core's store-conditional or ordinary store) will cause the store-conditional to fail

### 1.2. locks vs. transactions

```c
void transfer(A, B, amount) {
  synchronized(bank) {
    try {
      withdraw(A, amount);
      deposit(B, amount);
    }
    catch(exception1) {}
    catch(exception2) {}
  }
}

void transfer(A, B, amount) {
  atomic {
    withdraw(A, amount);
    deposit(B, amount);
  }
}
```

+ lock
  + programmer provides "undo" code on a case-by-case basis
  + locks may be held by a failing thread
+ transaction
  + system responsible for processing exceptions
  + **no partial commit**: transaction is aborted and memory updates are undone


```c
void transfer(A, B, amount) {
  synchronized(A) {
    synchronized(B) {
      withdraw(A, amount);
      deposit(B, amount);
    }
  }
}

// dead lock
transfer(A, B, 10);
transfer(B, A, 10);
```

+ **fine grained lock**: good for performance, but possibility of dead lock
  + requires system-wide policies to get correct
  + system-wide policies can break software modularity
+ **transactions**
  + system manages concurrency as well as possible serialization

### 1.3. pros/cons of TM

+ pros
  + easy to use
  + often perform as well as fine-grained locks
    + performance portability: locking scheme for 4 cpus may not be the best scheme for 64 cpus
  + failure atomicity and recovery
    + no lost locks when a thread fails
    + failure recovery = transaction abort + restart
  + composability
    + safe and scalable composition of software modules
+ cons
  + **not mutual exclusion**
    + can not just replace `synchronized` with `atomic`
  + atomic code sequence

```c
synchronized(lock1) {
  flagA = true;  // if atomic, cause code below to abort
  while (flagB == 0);
}

synchronized(lock2) {
  flagB = true;  // if atomic, cause code above to abort
  while (flagA == 0);
}
```

## 2. implementation of transactional memory

+ TM systems must provide atomicity and isolation
+ implementation requirements
  + **data versioning**
  + **conflict detection and resolution**
+ implementation policy
  + hardware transactional memory (HTM)
  + software transactional memory (STM)
  + hybrid transactional memory
    + hardware-accelerated STMs

### 2.1. data versioning

+ **data versioning**: manage uncommitted and previously committed versions of data for concurrent transactions
  + eager versioning (undo-log based)
  + lazy versioning (write-buffer based)

#### 2.1.1. **eager versioning**

update memory immediately, maintain "undo log" in case of abort

![](/assets/images/pp/10-3.png)

+ pro: faster commit
+ con: slower aborts, fault tolerance issues (roll back)

#### 2.1.2. **lazy versioning**

log memory updates in transaction write buffer, flush buffer on commit

![](/assets/images/pp/10-4.png)

+ pro: faster abort (only need to clear log)
+ con: slower commits

### 2.2. conflict detection

TM system must detect and handle conflicts between transactions.

+ read-write conflict: transaction A reads address X, which was written to by pending transaction B
+ write-write conflict: transactions A and B both pending, and both write to address X

Solution: **system must track a transaction's read set and write set**

+ read-set: addresses read within the transaction
+ write-set: addresses written within the transaction

**check**: whether a transaction's write set is overlapping with another transaction's read/write set

#### 2.2.1. pessimistic detection

+ check for conflicts **during each loads or stores**
  + **pessimistic**: I suspect conflicts might happen, so let's always check to see if one has occurred after each memory operation
+ "contention manager": decides to **stall** or abort transaction

![](/assets/images/pp/10-5.png)

#### 2.2.2. optimistic detection

+ detect conflicts when a transaction attempts to commit
  + HW: **only when we want to commit then we send cache coherence requests**
  + **optimistic**: let's hope for the best and sort out all the conflicts only when the transaction tries to commit
+ on a conflict, give priority to committing transaction: **can ensure we make progress**

**Note**: can use optimistic and pessimistic schemes together (optimistic for reads and pessimistic for writes)

注: 其他事务的**提交**可能导致某个正在进行的事务的restart。

#### 2.2.3. tradeoffs

+ pessimistic
  + pro: detect conflicts early
  + cons:
    + no forward progress guarantees
    + fine-grained communication
    + detection on critical path
+ optimistic
  + pros:
    + forward progress guarantees
    + bulk communication and conflict detection
  + cons:
    + detects conflicts late
    + fairness issue

conflicts detection granularity

+ object
+ machine word
+ cache line

### 2.3. real world

+ Hardware TM systems
  + lazy + optimistic
  + lazy + pessimistic
  + eager + pessimistic
  + eager + optimistic: **not practical, isolation is violated by this combination**. eager情况下内存已经更新了，乐观仅在commit时check，因此其它事务/非事务可能读到未提交的事务的更新。
+ Software TM systems
  + lazy + optimistic(rd/wr)
  + lazy + optimistic(rd)/pessimistic(wr)
  + eager + optimistic(rd)/pessimistic(wr)
  + eager + pessimistic(rd/wr)
+ Optimal design remains an open question

### 2.4. hardware transactional memory

+ data versioning is implemented in caches
  + cache the write buffer or the undo log
  + add new cache line metadata to track transaction read set and write set
+ conflict detection through cache coherence protocol
  + coherence lookups detect conflicts between transactions
+ Note
  + **register checkpoint** be taken at transaction begin, so that it is possible to restore execution context state on abort

#### 2.4.1. implementation details

![](/assets/images/pp/10-7.png)

+ data versioning
  + R bit: read set
  + W bit: write set
  + R/W bits cleared on transaction commit or abort
  + **eager versioning**: 2nd cache write for undo log
+ conflicts detection
  + observing shared request on W-word is a read-write conflict
  + observing exclusive request to R-word is a write-read conflict
  + observing exclusive request to W-word is a write-write conflict

#### 2.4.2. **lazy-optimistic** HTM implementation

![](/assets/images/pp/10-8.png)

+ CPU changes
  + ability to checkpoint register state
  + TM state registers (status, pointers to abort handlers)
+ Cache changes
  + R/W bit
+ transaction begin
  + **initialize CPU and cache state**
  + **take register checkpoint**
+ load operation
  + serve cache miss if needed
  + mark data as part of read set
+ store operation
  + serve cache miss if needed
  + mark data as part of write set (not a load into exclusive state because lazy)
+ transaction commit: **fast two-phase commit**
  + **validate**: request RdX access to write set lines (**UpgradeX**)
  + **commit**: gang-reset R and W bits, turns write set data to valid (dirty) data

![](/assets/images/pp/10-9.png)

+ fast conflict detection and abort
  + **check**: receive coherence requests from another core's commit, lookup read set and write set
  + **abort**: invalidate write set, gang-reset R/W bits, restore to register checkpoint

#### 2.4.3. real world: hardware transactional memory support in Intel Haswell

+ instructions
  + `xbegin`: takes pointer to "fallback address" in case of abort
  + `xend`
  + `xabort`
+ implementation: tracks read and write set in L1 cache
+ processor makes sure all memory operations commit atomically
  + processor may automatically abort transaction: eviction of line in read or write set, **even in the same transaction**

```c
// fallback address example
Result status = _xbegin();
if (status == SUCCESS) {
  if (_stop_the_world)
    _xabort();
  ...
  _xend();
} else {
  /* Fall back path */
  lock();
  _stop_the_world = true;
  ...
  _stop_the_world = false;
  unlock();
}
```

+ `_stop_the_world`: make sure fallback can proceed
  + in other words programmer should make sure
    + the fallback path must not overlap with other transactions
    + the lock path must prevent transactions from committing
  + TM implementation itself doesn't guarantee progress

#### 2.4.4. performance

+ TSX can only track a limited number of locations
  + minimize memory touched in case cache line eviction within a single transaction
+ transaction cost
  + approximately equal to the cost of six atomic primitives to the same cache line
