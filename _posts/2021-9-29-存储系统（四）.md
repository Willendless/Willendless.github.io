## 1. challenges to internal consistency

+ **concurrent modifications**
  + solution: concurrency control mechanisms
+ **media defect growth**
  + solution: redundancy
+ **transient storage subsystem error**
  + solution: integrity checks plus redundancy
+ **system crashes**: volatile main memory contents lost upon system failure
  + solution: on-disk image must be sufficiently consistent

## 2. overview

+ static mappings
+ "atomicity" of writes based on ECC
+ update ordering
+ real atomicity

### 2.1. ECC

+ unwritten guarantee provided by per-sector ECC
  + ECC check will fail if only partially written
+ good for inter-related updates
+ 注: 一个512字节的扇区的ECC通常能够纠正最多50字节的故障

### 2.2. update ordering

+ basic ordering rules: **to protect the integrity of metadata pointers**
  + **resource allocation**: initialize resource before setting pointer
  + **resource de-allocation**: nullify previous pointer before reuse
  + **resource "movement"**: set new pointer before nullify old one
+ prob: something always left dangling
  + recovery examines entire contents
    + rebuild free space/inode bitmaps
+ implementation
  + **synchronous writes**
    + wait for one write to complete before proceeding
    + bad performance
  + **soft updates**
    + use write-back caching for all updates
    + make sure updates propagate to disk in the correct order

### 2.3. real multi-write atomicity

idea: avoid immediate in-place update

+ approach 1: **write-ahead logging/journaling**
  + updates go to log first, then go to real location
+ approach 2: **shadow paging**
  + step 1: write new versions to new locations
  + step 2: change mappings to use new versions

#### 2.3.1. journaling details

TODO:

### 2.4. upper level applications

+ application level integrity: use file system API
  + **write with flag**: not return until finished
  + **fsync operation**: persist everything associated with that file
