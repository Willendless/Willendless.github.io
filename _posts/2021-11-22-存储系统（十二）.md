> Computation is evaluation.

## 1. Azure HPC Cache

+ high performance distributed file system workload
  + video rendering
+ NFS v3

## 2. Google: Colossus

+ layers of bigtable
+ heterogeneous storage
  + fixed hot data each storage device to balance the load

## 3. Kangaroo: hybrid SSD cache design

+ use SSD as cache
+ log structured cache
+ set-associative cache

## 4. IODA: tame tail latency for NVMe device

+ redundancy for taming tail latency
+ fast fail

## 5. VMWARE: vSAN, VDFS and Practical Cache Design

+ vSAN
  + RAID 6
+ VDFS
  + zero-copy data path
  + metadata operation:
    + shared memory ring buffer
    + vdfs server: poll based + put the reply back

### 5.1. practical cache design

+ **cache**: mitigate the cost of too many indirections
+ we want hit ratio >> cache ratio
  + cache ratio: cache size / main storage size
+ workload characteristics
  + spatial locality
  + temporal locality
  + **frequency**: root > leaf nodes
  + **sequential scan**
  + **large loop**
  + uniform random
    + content hash: don't work
    + how to cache?
+ **design principles of real world cache**
  + 通用性: balanced design for all scenarios
  + when miss ratio is high
    + reasonable miss ratio
  + when miss ratio is low
    + low CPU overhead
    + high concurrent
  + when cache head
    + low memory overhead
  + when code is in kernel
    + easy to implement
+ **whats wrong with LRU**
  + **head lock contention**: move a pointer to the head of the list
  + CPU overhead
  + bad hit ratio for sequential read/write

### 5.2. reduce lock contention

+ sharding by block number
  + similar to direct-mapped or set associative CPU cache

### 5.3. lower the CPU overhead

+ clock
+ less memory consumption

### 5.4. advanced replacement algorithm: 2Q

#### 5.4.1. basic 2Q

![](/assets/images/ss/12-1.png)

+ hot LRU
+ cold FIFO queue
  + **filters out correlated references**: not necessarily hot page
+ block number goes into the ghost FIFO
+ behavior of seq scan?
  + only change cold queue
+ behavior of large loop?
  + good ratio on hot lru

FIFO + LRU

#### 5.4.2. Clock 2Q

![](/assets/images/ss/12-2.png)

+ reduce CPU cost
  + replace LRU with clock
+ reduce memory size of LRU
  + clock uses 1-bit
+ reduce memory size of FIFO list
  + using array instead of list, saves memory used for pointers
+ does sharding work?
  + **cannot handle reservation, we need reserve certain number of blocks**

#### 5.4.3. Concurrent Clock 2Q

+ pre-allocate all entries at cache hit
+ use atomic variables for clock pointers
+ if thread is preemptive
  + spinlock: non-preemptive
  + **mutex**: preemptive, avoid get lock then be preemptived
+ ideal **load factor** of hash table
  + 0.75 nodes per bucket
  + RCU list?
    +  not premature
+ lock mechanism
  + cache lookup locking order
  + insert

#### 5.4.4. test concurrency

+ 


### 5.5. think exercise

+ not practical for read-write lock

## 6. Logs, objects and indexes - basic storage building blocks with subtle differences

+ logs
+ objects/files
+ index

### 6.1. case 1 disk

smr: change layout to log-structured

### 6.2. case 2 log/journal

+ consistency
+ backup/restore
+ atomicity
+ event capture

### 6.3. case 3 event bus

![](/assets/images/ss/12-3.png)

+ publish
+ republish

ques: the best way to implement an event bus

+ can we use S3 as an event bus?
  + create a new object and subscribe() could listens to object creations and pick up new object
+ can we use DynamoDB as an event bus?
  + publish() could add a row to a table and subscribe() could listen for new rows

point: reasonable but costly options at scale, do more than is needed

**only need a log and a filter**

### 6.4. case 4 analytics over streaming data

+ real time dashboard
+ real time fraud detection

anti-pattern: domain change

![](/assets/images/ss/12-5.png)

+ batch domain: object, large indexes
+ real time domain: temporary indexes over log windows
+ when to build new wheels?
  + when encountering cross-domain design problem
