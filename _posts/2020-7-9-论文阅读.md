## 阅读论文时考虑的问题

+ What is the problem this paper tried to solve? (Hint: please state the problem using data)
+ What is the root cause of the problem? In one sentence.
+ For each optimization, how does the author get the idea? (Hint: just imagine you’re the author. Given the problem, what experiment would you do to get more info?)
+ For each optimization, does it always work? In which case it cannot work?
+ Do you have some better ideas to implement a faster FS?

## 阅读论文的步骤

+ First time: please scan the entire paper for the first time. Read the first sentence of each paragraph and try to understand the logic of the whole article.
+ Second time: read the paper again carefully. For each optimization, please use one sentence as summary. If you’re not familiar with the tech, just mark and skip it.
+ Why the old FS is not good enough?
+ Pay attention to “File System Parameterization”, you may need to read it many times.
+ For evaluation part, please ask yourself why the author test in this way, and what else do you think should be measured.
+ Third time: go back and find all the mark places, using Google to find more about the them, try to understand in their context.
+ Fourth time: selectively read parts of the paper with the questions in mind, and answer them.
+ Final: read the description of FFS in Remzi's "three easy pieces" (pdf), for better understanding.
