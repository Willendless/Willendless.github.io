## 1. message passing abstraction

+ threads operate within their own **private address spaces**
+ communicated by sending/receiving messages
  + send:
    + recipient
    + buffer to transmitted
    + **optional message identifier(tag)**
  + receive:
    + sender
    + buffer to store data
    + **optional message identifier(tag)**
+ only source knows the destination address
+ only destination knows the source address
+ application
  + **network transaction**: one-way transfer of information from a source output buffer to a destination input buffer
  + **shared address space abstraction**: two-way request/response protocol with ack
    + remote operations can be performed on remote memory
+ synchronous
  + send completed after matching receive and source data sent
  + receive completes after data transfer complete from matching send
+ asynchronous:
  + send completes after send buffer may be reused

## 2. synchronous message passing

+ matching phase
  + initiate send
  + address translation
  + local/remote check
  + send-ready request
  + **remote check for posted receive**
  + reply transaction
+ data transfer phase
  + source VA -> Dest VA

+ no need to consider contention and buffering at destination
+ performance is terrible

## 3. asynchronous message passing

### 3.1. optimistic async

+ initiate send
+ address translation
+ local/remote check
+ send data
+ remote check for posted receive; on fail, allocate data buffer

+ pros
  + good for short messages
+ cons
  + **buffer overflow**
  + storage is required within the message layer

### 3.2. conservative async

+ matching phase
  + initiate send
  + address translation
  + local/remote check
  + send ready request, then local can resume computing
  + remote check for posted receive; **record** send-ready
+ data transfer phase
  + when remote call receive then allocate buffer and send ready request
  + local receive ready request
  + transfer data
    + source VA -> Dest VA

+ pros
  + safer, no contention for buffering
+ cons
  + **short messages have high latency**

### 3.3. features of message passing abstraction

+ source knows **send address**, destination knows **receive address**
  + no need for service discovery
+ arbitrary storage "outside of the local address spaces"
+ fundamentally a 3-phase transaction

### 3.4. credit-based async

+ hybrid method
  + pre-allocate limited amount of space(credit) **per sender**
  + optimistic async: if the sender knows it has sufficient credit at a receiver
  + conservative async: no sufficient credit
+ implementation: **tracking credit limit**
  + decreased upon send
  + increased piggybacked with msgs

### 3.5. avoidling fetch deadlock

+ prob: **must continue accepting messages**, even when cannot source msgs
  + what if incoming transaction is a request
+ solution: **must continue accepting messages, even if result cannot sending out**
  + approach 1: logically independent request/reply networks
    + physical networks
    + virtual channels
  + approach 2: bound requests and reserve input buffer space
  + approach 3: NACK on input buffer call
